**AirBnB Clone Project**
This project is a personal initiative to create a simplified, functional clone of the popular online lodging marketplace, AirBnB. The goal is to build a robust, scalable web application from the ground up, focusing on core features and best practices in software development.

**Project Overview**
The application will allow users to:

Sign up and log in.

Browse a list of available properties.

View details for a specific property.

Book a property for a specific date range.

Manage their own listings and bookings.

**Goals**
Gain hands-on experience: Apply knowledge of web development to a real-world project.

Build a full-stack application: Develop both the front-end (user interface) and back-end (server, database) components.

Demonstrate proficiency: Create a portfolio-ready project showcasing skills in various technologies.

Collaborate and learn: Work with a project team (as a simulated environment) and document the process.

**Tech Stack**
Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React)

Back-end: Python (Flask), RESTful API

Database: MySQL

**Team Roles**
Based on the project's needs and industry standards, here are the roles and responsibilities for a project team working on a web application like this AirBnB clone.

**Backend Developer**
The Backend Developer is responsible for the server-side logic and core functionality that users don't see directly. In this project, their responsibilities include:

**Developing APIs:** Building the RESTful APIs that handle communication between the front-end and the database, such as creating new user accounts or fetching property details.

**Managing Business Logic:** Implementing the core functions of the application, including user authentication, booking validation, and payment processing.

**Database Interaction:** Working with the Database Administrator to integrate the application with the database, ensuring data can be stored, retrieved, and updated efficiently.

**Security and Scalability:** Implementing security measures to protect user data and writing code that can handle a growing number of users and properties.

**Database Administrator (DBA)**
The Database Administrator is a specialist focused on the health, security, and performance of the database system. In a project like this, their duties include:

**Database Design:** Creating the database schema, including tables, relationships, and indexes, to efficiently store all the project's data (users, properties, bookings, reviews, etc.).

**Performance Tuning:** Monitoring database performance and optimizing complex queries to ensure fast load times and a smooth user experience.

**Data Security:** Establishing and maintaining security protocols, managing user access rights, and protecting sensitive information like user passwords and payment details.

**Backup and Recovery:** Implementing a robust system for regular data backups and creating a plan to recover the database in case of data loss or system failure.
